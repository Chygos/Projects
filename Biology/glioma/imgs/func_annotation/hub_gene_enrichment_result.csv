"22097","","""The junction between an axon of one neuron and a dendrite of another neuron, a muscle fiber or a glial cell. As the axon approaches the synapse it enlarges into a specialized structure, the presynaptic terminal bouton, which contains mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. At the tip of the terminal bouton is the presynaptic membrane; facing it, and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft) is a specialized area of membrane on the receiving cell, known as the postsynaptic membrane. In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic terminal bouton secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane.""

"4958","","Interictal refers to a period of time between epileptic seizures. Electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns are important in the differential diagnosis of epilepsy, and the EEG is almost always abnormal during a seizure. Some persons with seizures may show EEG abnormalities between seizures, while others do not. In some cases, multiple interictal EEGs must be recorded before an abnormality is observed. In most cases the electrographic pattern of seizure onset is completely different from the activity recorded during interictal discharge.","""HP""","CNTNAP2|SNAP25|KCNC1|SLC32A1|GABRG2|SCN8A|KCNQ2|KCNA1|STXBP1|CAMK2A|CACNA1B|GRIN2A|GABRD|GABRA1|GABBR2|SLC12A5|SYT1|GAD1|SCN2A","19","5968","6060|6016|6030|5998|6094|6054|6058|6076|6066|6112|6064|6050|6072|6090|6020|6088|6022|6056|6108","1.426226710376768E-9","0.4634146341463415","41","0.058823529411764705","Human Phenotype Ontology","HP:0025373","Interictal EEG abnormality","323"
