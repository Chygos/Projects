## **Sunspot forecasting**
This is aimed at building two time-series models to forecast the monthly average number of sunspots for the year 2023 and the average yearly number of sunspots for the next 11 years. The counting of sunspots is one way of monitoring the Solar cycle and its activities. It takes about 11 years for the Sun to complete its cycle. At the beginning of the cycle, the number of sunspots observed is at its minimum. It peaks at about 5-6 years before declining toward the end of the Solar cycle.

## **New York city yellow taxi cab demand**
This is aimed at analysing yellow taxi cab demand by commuters in all the pickup stations in the city of New York. The dataset was downloaded from the [Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) website](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). Paid taxi cabs ordered by commuters from Jan 2019 to Mar. 2024 were used for analysis. The original data contains taxi cabs ordered at a pickup station per hour as well as the destination station. After downloading the dataset from the source, it was aggregated into the total number of yellow taxis demanded by commuters in a pickup station per hour of a day. The amount of money generated in revenue, the average distance and duration of trip were also aggregated. Similarly, the total number of taxis going to each destination station was aggregated. These datasets were saved into a database and accessed through it for analysis.
