# **Projects**

This repository contains jupyter notebooks (and other files) of personal, school projects and internship tasks. Each notebook includes a top-to-bottom data science workflow, from data ingestion, preparation, visualisation, and preprocessing, to modelling.

## [**Sunspot forecasting**](./sunspot_forecasting/)

This is aimed at building two time-series models to forecast the monthly average number of sunspots for the year 2023 and the average yearly number of sunspots for the next 11 years. The counting of sunspots is one way of monitoring the Solar cycle and its activities. It takes about 11 years for the Sun to complete its cycle. At the beginning of the cycle, the number of sunspots observed is at its minimum. It peaks at about 5-6 years before declining toward the end of the Solar cycle.

## [**New York city yellow taxi cab demand**](./Taxi_demand_analysis/)

This is aimed at analysing yellow taxi cab demand by commuters in all the pickup stations in the city of New York. The dataset was downloaded from the [Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) website](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). Paid taxi cabs ordered by commuters from Jan 2019 to Mar. 2024 were used for analysis. The original data contains taxi cabs ordered at a pickup station per hour and the destination station. After downloading the dataset from the source, it was aggregated into the total number of yellow taxis demanded by commuters in a pickup station per hour of the day. The amount of money generated in revenue, the average distance and the duration of the trip were also aggregated. Similarly, the number of taxis going to each destination station was aggregated. These datasets were saved into a database and accessed through it for analysis.

## [**Capital Bike Share**](./CapitalBikeShare/)

This is aimed at analysing the performance of city bike sharing in Washington DC, United States. Performance indicators were aimed at investigating the acceptance of bike sharing by Washington DC residents from Jan 2022 to Jun 2024. The dataset was downloaded from [Capital Bike share website](https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html). The original dataset contained bike rides made by members and non-members of the platform at all bike stations at different times of the day. More information can be found [here](https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data). 
Bike rides within a certain hour by registered and casual members with either classic or electric bikes were aggregated. The total distance and the average duration of rides were extracted and stored in a comma-separated values file. Data exploration, preprocessing and analysis were done on a Jupyter notebook with an R kernel.
