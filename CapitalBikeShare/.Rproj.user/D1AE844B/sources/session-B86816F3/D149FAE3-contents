# Questions

In this report, we will investigate the following questions.

## Question 1

Were Black people stopped disproportionately often by the Metropolitan Police compared to white people in the past two decades and if so, how has this discrepancy changed following the police shooting of Mark Duggan.
    
To operationalise this question, we consider whether the relative disparity has been above 1 between 2006/07 and 2019/20 and how it has evolved in the years following 2010/11. Here, relative disparity is defined as the stop-and-search rate for Black people divided by the stop-and-search rate for White people.

# Analysis

## Answer to Question 1

The figure below illustrates that Black people were stopped disproportionately often by the Metropolitan Police compared to white people in every year between 2006/07 and 2019/20. In addition, the disparity in the stop-and-search rate for Black people (relative to white people) decreased slightly following the 2011 police shooting of Mark Duggan but increased again starting from 2013/14 with the exception of 2019/20.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 3.5}
# The following lines of code add a column relative_disparity to the data
# set which calculated the relative disparity, i.e. the rate at which
# Black people are stopped divided by the rate at which white people are 
# stopped. This variable is also used in the second question.
reference_rate <- stop_search_1 %>%
  filter(ethnicity == "White") %>%
  rename(rate_white = rate) %>%
  select(year, legislation_type, geography, rate_white) %>%
  distinct()
stop_search_1 %>%
  left_join(reference_rate, 
            by = c("year", "legislation_type", "geography")) %>%
  mutate(relative_disparity = rate / rate_white) %>%
  distinct() -> stop_search_2

stop_search_2 %>%
  filter(geography == "Metropolitan Police") %>%
  filter(ethnicity == "Black") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = relative_disparity, group = "Black")) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, # make labels vertical
                                   hjust = 1, # right-adjust horizontally
                                   vjust = 0.5) # center vertically
  ) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 5)) +
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Relative Disparity")
